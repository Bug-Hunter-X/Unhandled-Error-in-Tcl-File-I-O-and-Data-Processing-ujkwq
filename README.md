This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming related to error handling during file I/O and data processing. The `bug.tcl` file shows the original code with the error, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The main issue is that the original `catch` statement only catches errors from the `process_data` procedure and not from `get_data` itself. The improved version uses nested `catch` statements to handle potential errors from both functions.
